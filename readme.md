#Interact with Dynamics CRM using nodejs

# Project description

DynamicsNode is a library built on node.js that allows you to quickly create scripts to interact with Microsoft Dynamics CRM using JavaScript.

The main goal of DynamicsNode is to make you very productive when it comes to automate small tasks in Dynamics CRM. Just create a .js file, add a few lines and execute it.

No more .net console applications with all the boilerplate code just for creating one record. Go productive!
